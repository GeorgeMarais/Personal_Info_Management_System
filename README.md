# Personal_Info_Management_System

## Problem:
It can prove challenging when fulling out various forms and applications to find all the information you need. Whether you are a manager, parent, or individual that needs access to various personal information you might not have a secure and centralized place to store it.

## Objectives:
- Create an application to safely store and aggregate individual or multi-person information stores.
- Ensure that a user can have their own information store with the ability to add dependants/sub-stores (This should be a mono-directional relationship).
- Information should be accessible, irregardless of the store, in a very simple way.

## Tech Stack:
- Java
- SQL
